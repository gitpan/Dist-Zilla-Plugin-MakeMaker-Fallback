Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-MakeMaker-Fallback

0.008     2014-03-23 02:43:22Z
          - properly dump configs by resolving silent role composition sub
            clobbering issue

0.007     2014-03-09 05:35:08Z
          - switch to renamed form of now-deprecated plugin
            [MungeData::WithDataSection]
          - "dzil test" will run tests without extra testing variables, for
            "dzil release" or "dzil test --release" -- this will weed out test
            issues that only manifest when AUTHOR_TESTING or RELEASE_TESTING
            are *not* set (e.g. bad test count, conditional module loading).

0.006     2014-01-25 03:52:42Z
          - now sorting the dumped %configure_requires prereqs, for
            minimizing diffs between releases

0.005     2013-12-14 17:25:20Z
          - warnings can now be bypassed entirely with the
            PERL_MM_FALLBACK_SILENCE_WARNING environment variable
          - now also mentioning the relevant CPAN.pm/CPANPLUS configuration
            options

0.004     2013-11-20 21:49:00Z
          - tighten up the interactive terminal detection logic

0.003     2013-10-15 01:26:28Z
          - only display the warning if configure_require prereqs are
            genuinely missing (the user may have explicitly chosen to run
            Makefile.PL) (RT#89434)

0.002     2013-09-25 02:15:24Z
          - bump up dependency on [MakeMaker::Awesome] to avoid missing lib
            errors

0.001     2013-09-22 21:33:34Z
          - Initial release.
